Creating a website that helps users search for stocks and see stock predictions on the charts with the help of deep neural networks. It also shows the most relevant news related to the stock along with news 
that affects general stock trends. There are neural networks that analyze this news and help you make better stock predictions. 

The neural nets deployed on the news classify whether the stock is likely to make:
1. Short term gains.
2. Long term gains.
3. Short term losses.
4. Long term losses. 

The neural networks deployed on the stock market chart predict the future prices. The user can change the data frame which should help them with their trading regardless of whether they are
trading short term or long term.
