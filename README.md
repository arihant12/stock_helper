Creating a website that helps users search for stocks and see the relevant news related to the stock and how each news is likely to move the stock price.  It also shows the news that affects general stock trends. There are neural networks that analyze this news and help you make better stock predictions. 

The neural nets deployed on the news classify the news into three sections:
1. High Impact +/-
2. Medium Impact +/-
3. Low Impact +/-

We also have a section for news that would cause fast changes in a particular stock price or the market overall.
